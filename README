NAME
    Catalyst::Plugin::Session::FastMmap - FastMmap sessions for Catalyst

SYNOPSIS
        use Catalyst qw/Session Session::Store::FastMmap Session::State::Foo/;
    
        MyApp->config->{session} = {
            expires => 3600,
            storage => '/tmp/session'
        };

        # ... in an action:
        $c->session->{foo} = 'bar'; # will be saved

DESCRIPTION
    "Catalyst::Plugin::Session::Store::FastMmap" is a fast session storage
    plugin for Catalyst that uses an mmap'ed file to act as a shared memory
    interprocess cache. It is based on "Cache::FastMmap".

  METHODS
    get_session_data
    store_session_data
    delete_session_data
    delete_expired_sessions
        These are implementations of the required methods for a store. See
        Catalyst::Plugin::Session::Store.

    setup_session
        Sets up the session cache file.

CAVEATS
    Very loaded sites with lots of data in the session hash may have old
    sessions expired prematurely, due to the LRU caching policy employed by
    Cache::FastMmap. To get around this you can increase the "cache_size"
    parameter, or switch session storage backends.

    Cache::FastMmap defaults to around 5mb (89 * 64k).

CONFIGURATION
    These parameters are placed in the hash under the "session" key in the
    configuration hash.

    storage
        Specifies the file to be used for the sharing of session data. The
        default value will use File::Spec to find the default tempdir, and
        use a file named "MyApp_session_data", where "MyApp" is replaced
        with the appname.

        Note that the file will be created with mode 0640, which means that
        it will only be writeable by processes running with the same uid as
        the process that creates the file. If this may be a problem, for
        example if you may try to debug the program as one user and run it
        as another, specify a filename like "/tmp/session-$>", which
        includes the UID of the process in the filename.

    init_file
    cache_size
        See the Cache::FastMmap documentation for the meaning of these keys.
        If these keys are not present Cache::FastMmap's defaults will be
        used.
